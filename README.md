# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis

The purpose of this project is using the knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First, I will use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then I will use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm. By using these algorithms, I will resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

## Outline of the project

  . Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
  
  . Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
  
  . Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
  
  . Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
